Objective:
The macro is aimed to help analysers to get their LEGO train outputs. Two cases are addressed:
  1. "Train merging successful", outputs can be collectly directly
  2. "Train merging failed", outputs have to be merged locally:
    a. merging is performed at "Stage_*" level
    b. merging is performed at "processing" level
    c. merging is performed on a per-run basis

Constraint:
  - Bash scripting written in a portable way (if possible)
  - Making use of AliEn/AliRoot environment
